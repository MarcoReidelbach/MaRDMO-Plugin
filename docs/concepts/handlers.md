# Handlers

When a user selects an existing item from the MaRDI Portal or Wikidata in a questionnaire field, MaRDMO automatically retrieves and fills in all associated metadata — labels, descriptions, relations, and linked sub-entities — without any manual copying.  This is the job of the *handlers*.

## Signal Wiring

RDMO emits a `value_created` or `value_updated` signal every time a questionnaire answer is saved by the user.  MaRDMO registers signal receivers in `router.py`.

At startup, `build_handler_map()` constructs a nested lookup table:

```
{ catalog_uri: { attribute_uri: handler_method } }
```

On each incoming signal the router checks the active catalog and the URI of the saved attribute, and dispatches to the matching handler method.  A separate `DELETE_HANDLER_MAP` handles cleanup when a value is removed: it deletes all dependent answers that were previously filled in for that entity.

## Why Not Django Signals for the Cascade?

`value_editor()` — the helper that writes answers back into the project — saves values directly to the database.  If these writes triggered Django signals, every programmatic fill would re-activate handlers, creating runaway cascades.

More critically, during an RDMO project import all values are written to the database in bulk while Django signals are already active.  Using signals for the fill cascade would cause handlers to fire out of order against a partially-loaded project, producing incomplete or corrupt results.  MaRDMO therefore uses **direct function calls** for all handler-to-handler cascading, ensuring that fills only happen in response to genuine user interactions.

## Handler Flow

The sequence when a user picks a *Mathematical Model* from the portal:

1. RDMO emits `value_created` / `value_updated` for the model ID field.
2. The router dispatches to `Information.model(instance)`.
3. `model()` calls `_entry()`, which collects the selected QID and calls `_fill_model_batch()`.
4. `_fetch_by_source()` fires a **single SPARQL query** (against MaRDI Portal, and optionally Wikidata) to retrieve the model's metadata.
5. `_fill_model_batch()` writes labels, descriptions, aliases, properties, and relations into the appropriate questionnaire pages via `value_editor()`.
6. For each related sub-entity type (Research Problems, Mathematical Formulations, Computational Tasks, …), `_fill_model_batch()` calls `_hydrate_relatants()`, which in turn calls the corresponding `_fill_*_batch()` method **directly** — no signal is emitted.
7. Each `_fill_*_batch()` call batches its SPARQL query across **all** entities of that type at once.  For example, if the selected model contains ten Mathematical Formulations, all ten are fetched in a single query and then distributed across the ten questionnaire pages.  The same applies to linked Research Problems, Computational Tasks, and so on.
8. A `visited` set is passed through the entire call tree to prevent infinite loops when entities reference each other cyclically.

The batching principle ensures that the number of SPARQL queries scales with the number of distinct *entity types* in the cascade, not with the number of individual entities.

## Pre-Save Validation

In addition to the post-save handler dispatch, MaRDMO registers a `pre_save` receiver on the RDMO `Value` model.  Before every questionnaire answer is written to the database, the router looks up the attribute URI in `PRESAVE_VALIDATOR_MAP` and calls the matching validator function if one is registered.  A validator raises `rest_framework.exceptions.ValidationError` to reject the value; RDMO surfaces the error message inline next to the offending question in the interview UI without disrupting the rest of the page.

`PRESAVE_VALIDATOR_MAP` is assembled once at startup by `build_presave_validator_map()` and covers the model, algorithm, and workflow catalogs.  Four validators are provided:

| Validator | Applies to | What it checks |
|---|---|---|
| `validate_value_format` | Relation questions | Text must match `Label (Description)` or `Label (Description) [source]` |
| `validate_short_description` | Description questions | Text must not exceed 2000 characters |
| `validate_qudt_id` | QUDT reference questions | Text must match `^[A-Z][a-zA-Z_\-]*$` when an option is selected |
| `validate_properties` | Data-property questions | Selected options must not form a mutually exclusive pair |

Pre-save validation only guards **user input**.  When handlers write portal-fetched data programmatically via `value_editor()`, those writes also trigger `pre_save`.  To prevent valid portal data from being incorrectly rejected, `adders.py` sanitizes the data before calling `value_editor()`:

- **`add_properties`** — collects all incoming property option URIs, identifies every mutually exclusive pair, and silently drops the entire conflicting pair.  Neither side can be judged correct when the portal itself reports a contradiction.
- **`add_references`** — skips any QUDT reference entry whose text does not match `^[A-Z][a-zA-Z_\-]+$` (strict format required for complete portal data).

Any values dropped during sanitization are surfaced by the documentation checker at export time, prompting the user to correct them manually.
